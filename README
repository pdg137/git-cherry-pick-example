This is an example of cherry picking in git.
We are checking whether cherry-picking works smoothly even as files are renamed.

Actually, it turned out that renaming did not work smoothly, because
git sees a rename as nothing but a delete and an add, so it does not
know that the files should share history.  But we can at least
demonstrate that cherry picking allows backporting of bug fixes from a
feature branch onto a main branch before releasing the feature!
